# Code Intelligence Features Implementation

## Overview
Integrated three code intelligence analysis features into the CodeSensei platform under the "üß† Code Intelligence" tab.

## Files Created/Modified

### 1. `intelligence_analyzer.py` (New)
Core analyzer module with four analysis types:

#### Classes and Methods:
- **`CodeIntelligenceAnalyzer`**: Main orchestrator class
  - `analyze_codebase_from_files()`: Main entry point for all analyses
  - `_analyze_complexity()`: Cyclomatic complexity & maintainability analysis
  - `_analyze_orphan_code()`: Dead code detection via call graph
  - `_analyze_patterns()`: Code pattern mining
  - `_analyze_similarity()`: Placeholder for future neural analysis
  - `_analyze_file_calls()`: Build call graph for orphan detection
  - `_extract_patterns()`: AST-based pattern extraction

### 2. `requirements.txt` (Modified)
Added dependencies:
```txt
radon>=6.0.0
networkx>=3.0
```

### 3. `app_new.py` (Modified)
- Added import for `CodeIntelligenceAnalyzer`
- Added session state variables for analysis results
- Completely rewrote `render_intelligence_tab()` function

## Features Implemented

### 1. üìä Complexity & Maintainability
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Implemented

**Analysis:**
- Cyclomatic complexity per function
- Maintainability index per module
- Lines of code metrics
- Function-level complexity statistics

**Output:**
- Summary metrics (avg complexity, complex functions count)
- Top 15 most complex functions with detailed breakdown
- File location and line ranges for each function

**Technology:** `radon` library

### 2. üîç Orphan Code Detection
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Implemented

**Analysis:**
- Builds static call graph using NetworkX
- Identifies functions/classes with no incoming calls (orphans)
- Filters out special methods (`__init__`, dunders, etc.)
- Tracks entry points (top-level functions)

**Output:**
- Summary statistics (total definitions, orphan count, percentage)
- List of up to 30 orphan functions
- List of up to 20 orphan classes
- File location and line numbers for each orphan

**Technology:** `networkx` for graph analysis, `ast` for parsing

### 3. üîó Code Similarity Clustering
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Implemented

**Analysis:**
- Neural code embeddings using CodeBERT model
- K-means clustering of similar functions
- Cosine similarity computation between functions
- Adaptive clustering based on function count

**Output:**
- Summary statistics (total functions, clusters, similar pairs)
- Top 20 similar function pairs with similarity scores
- Function code previews for each pair
- Cluster groupings showing semantically similar functions

**Technology:** 
- `transformers` (CodeBERT model: microsoft/codebert-base)
- `torch` for neural inference
- `scikit-learn` for K-means clustering and cosine similarity
- `numpy` for matrix operations

**Model Caching:** Models are cached in `./models/codebert/` directory to avoid repeated downloads

### 4. üéØ Pattern Mining
**Status:** ‚úÖ Fully Implemented

**Analysis:**
- AST-based extraction of control flow patterns
- Tracks FOR_LOOP, WHILE_LOOP, CONDITIONAL, TRY_EXCEPT, CONTEXT_MANAGER
- Counts pattern frequencies across codebase
- Identifies common coding idioms

**Output:**
- Total patterns and functions analyzed
- Top 15 most common patterns with frequency counts
- Pattern sequence visualization
- Percentage distribution

**Technology:** Python `ast` module

## User Interface

### Main Tab Structure
```
üß† Code Intelligence
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üìä Complexity & Maintainability
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîç Orphan Code Detection
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ üîó Code Similarity
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ üéØ Pattern Mining
```

### Workflow
1. User enters codebase (GitHub URL or local path)
2. Files are loaded from cache (GitHub) or directly (local)
3. User clicks "Run Analysis" button in desired subtab
4. Analysis runs with progress spinner
5. Results are displayed with:
   - Summary metrics
   - Detailed breakdowns in expandable sections
   - File locations and line numbers

### Session State Management
- Results persist across tab switches
- Analysis only runs once unless re-triggered
- State cleared when changing codebases

## Installation

Install required dependencies:
```bash
pip install radon networkx
```

Or install all CodeSensei dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage Example

1. **Load a codebase** (GitHub or local)
2. **Navigate to üß† Code Intelligence tab**
3. **Run desired analysis:**
   - Click "Run Complexity Analysis" for metrics
   - Click "Detect Orphan Code" for dead code
   - Click "Mine Code Patterns" for pattern discovery
4. **Review results** in the expanded sections

## Technical Details

### File Loading
- GitHub repos: Load from `./cache/{project_name}/` directory
- Local paths: Direct file system access
- Filters: Excludes test files, examples, __pycache__

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if dependencies missing
- Try-catch blocks around AST parsing
- Error messages displayed in UI

### Performance
- Analysis runs synchronously with UI feedback
- Large codebases may take several seconds
- Results are cached in session state

## Future Enhancements

1. **Code Similarity (Neural)**
   - Download and cache transformer models locally
   - Implement cosine similarity calculations
   - Add 2D visualization of code space

2. **Export Results**
   - JSON report download
   - CSV export for metrics
   - HTML report generation

3. **Real-time Updates**
   - Background processing
   - Progress bars for each file
   - Cancel button for long-running analyses

4. **Additional Metrics**
   - Code duplication detection
   - Technical debt estimation
   - Dependency analysis
   - Test coverage correlation

## Notes

- Heavy transformer models deferred to prevent initial download overhead
- All analyses are static (AST-based), no execution required
- Compatible with dark mode UI
- Responsive layout with columns and expanders
